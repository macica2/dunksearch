                        <li>Try using the advanced filters to narrow down the results</li>
                        <li>Try searching for a key word or 2 instead of an entire quote. Sometimes different words have better results.</li>
                        <li>Try alternate spellings of words, since sometimes the auto-generated captions aren't quite right.</li>
                        <li>You can wrap your search in quotes "like this" to search for an exact text match. This ignores capitalization.</li>
                        <li>If the quote was broken into multiple captions, such as "I'll have the spaghetti" and "and meatballs", then you may need to try searching for just one part of the quote.</li>
                        <li>For videos with auto-generated subtitles, certain swear words are replaced with [ __ ] which is not searchable. If your search term includes a swear and the captions are auto-generated, then you likely won't be able to find the quote without changing your search term.</li>
                        <li>Some videos are not able to be searched. See the <i>Are there any supported videos?</i> question below.</li>
                        <li>If you still cannot find a quote, try asking in the Weekly Search Megathread on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videogamedunkey/" target="_blank">videogamedunkey subreddit.</a></li>

                        <li>I extracted the captions from all of Dunkey's YouTube videos. I processed these captions and entered them into a database to make them easily searchable.</li>
                        <li>The search functionality is built using PostgreSQL Full Text Search. Each line of a caption gets parsed into key words. For example, the quote "I'll have the spaghetti and meatballs" gets broken down into "ll':2 'meatbal':7 'spaghetti':5".</li>
                        <li>When a search term is entered, it will also be broken down into key words. The site will then try to find captions that have those key words in common.</li>
                        <li>Search results are sorted in order of video upload date, then by the timestamp in the video.</li>

                    Once the site is launched and in use, I will consider setting up the ability to donate. I don't want to run ads if I don't have to.
