# DunkSearch.Database
This project contains PostgreSQL scripts. It is used to restore, initialize, or delete the database with the proper tables, starting data, and so on. 
Even though it is a SQL project, it is not meant to actually be executed in any way since it uses PostgreSQL syntax.
Copy and paste the script contents to run the queries manually with a tool like pgAdmin.
Start with CreateTables, then run PopulateTables.
